The fifth and last file for this project is the WebController.java, which consists of the file itself and two more addotional files, that being Controller.java and GetMapping.java

The purpose of this document is to examine and have a good explanation of the many support files and which specific main java file are they supporting in order for the functioning to work. Without these instruction and explanation, It would be a lot more harder to get aound and understand what the project is all about.
